# MyLifeStyle Application
This application is is a comprehensive tool for monitoring daily activities and managing lifestyle data. It allows users to track activities like running distance, gym hours, water intake, and favorite music, while also calculating daily calorie needs based on gender.

The myLifeStyle application is a comprehensive lifestyle monitoring tool designed to track and record various aspects of an individual's daily activities. This documentation serves as a project specification for the myLifeStyle application, outlining its key features and functionality. 

The purpose of the myLifeStyle application is to provide users with a centralized platform for monitoring and managing their lifestyle-related data. It allows users to track activities such as running distance, gym workout hours, water consumption, and favorite music. Additionally, the application calculates the daily calorie requirements based on the user's gender.

Once an entry is created, the user is able to evaluate the quality of his/her sport with the following app stats: km run, hours spent at the gym and drinking water.

Upon creating an entry in the myLifeStyle application, users are provided with the functionality to assess the effectiveness and quality of their physical activities. The application offers insightful statistics on key performance indicators such as the distance covered in kilometers during running sessions, the total hours dedicated to gym workouts, and the volume of water consumed. These app statistics enable users to evaluate their sports performance and make informed decisions regarding their fitness routines and hydration practices.

The myLifeStyle application incorporates data visualization features that enable users to access daily charts representing the quality statistics based on their selected category. By inputting the desired category, users can view the daily chart for the previous week or month, depending on their preference. The chart is designed to visually represent the trend of the selected quality stat and changes color from green to red if the trend observed over the specified period is negative. Specifically, if the average kilometers ran falls below 4, the average hours spent at the gym is less than 1, or the average drinking water intake is below 2, the chart color transitions from green to red, indicating a decline in performance or adherence to the desired goals. This color-coded representation assists users in quickly assessing their progress and identifying areas that may require improvement or further attention. 

Potential future enhancements: Smart device integration (e.g., smartwatches) for seamless lifestyle monitoring, enabling real-time data synchronization and expanded tracking capabilities.
